# TCPGecko-Ex
TCPGecko+ adds functionality to the original TCPGecko.
New features include
1. Support for TCPGecko .Net
2. Support for multiple JGecko connections!
3. Prevention of freezing due to heavy code usage!

# Attention!

Freeze protection does not work on Gctu!

We do not support the TCPGecko .NET itself.

We do not guarantee any scandals happened with this tool.
